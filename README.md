# SMIL – Self-Made Interactive Learning

A personal project series focused on learning and improving Python skills — one day, one challenge at a time.

These projects are created with the help of ChatGPT and built by me as part of my journey to become a better programmer. They start simple and gradually increase in difficulty.

> 💡 Some of the code is written in Indonesian.
