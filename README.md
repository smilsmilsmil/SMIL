# SMIL – Self-Made, In Learning 💻

Welcome! I'm SMIL, and this is my personal space for self-made Python projects — one small build at a time.

These are beginner-friendly CLI apps made by me, with help from ChatGPT, as part of my mission to grow as a developer. The projects start simple and scale in complexity as I improve.
